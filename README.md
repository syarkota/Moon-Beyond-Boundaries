# Moon-Beyond-Boundaries
Moon Beyond Boundaries is an immersive VR experience designed and developed during the NASA SPACE APPS CHALLENGE (Aug 2023). This project simulates walking on the Moon's surface, potential habitats, rover movement, and moonquakes using Blender and Unity. The experience is deployable on Android, web, and VR headsets.

## Features
- **Lunar Surface Simulation:** Experience realistic Moon terrain using high-fidelity 3D models.
- **Potential Habitats:** Explore future human habitats designed based on NASA research.
- **Rover Simulation:** Observe how lunar rovers navigate the Moon's surface.
- **Moonquake Simulation:** Witness dynamic simulations of moonquakes and their effects.
- **Cross-Platform Deployment:** Available for Android, web, and VR headsets.

## Technologies Used
- **Blender:** 3D modeling and animation
- **Unity:** VR development and deployment
- **VR Toolkit:** For VR compatibility

## Installation & Setup
### Requirements
- Unity 2021+ (or latest LTS version)
- Blender (for 3D assets modification)
- XR Plugin Management (for VR deployment)

### Steps
1. Open the project in Unity.
3. Ensure **XR Plugin Management** is enabled for VR builds.
4. Build and run on your target platform (Android/Web/VR Headset).

## How to Use
- Navigate the lunar surface using VR controllers or keyboard/mouse.
- Interact with rover models and habitat structures.
- Activate moonquake simulations via UI elements.

## Future Improvements
- Implement real-time physics simulations for lunar dust.
- AI-based navigation for autonomous rovers.
- Multiplayer exploration mode.
